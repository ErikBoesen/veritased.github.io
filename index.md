## Introduction
American society is becoming more diverse and multicultural than ever, but immigration policy debates are contentious, our society is divided, and many foreign residents of the U.S. wonder whether they are welcome here.

At the same time, the American education system remains as attractive as ever. Our education system is one of the most successful ways that we interact with the world. Over one million international students now study in the United States, bringing more than $30 billion per year to the U.S. economy. Younger and younger students are coming to the U.S. The number of international undergraduate students exceeded the number of graduate students for the first time in 2015, and in recent years the number of international students enrolled in American high schools has surged. America’s ability to attract more and more students, including younger students, is evidence of soft power--even amidst the fluctuations of global politics and economics.

In this climate, it is more important than ever that the U.S. care well for students from other countries. International students represent an opportunity for American educators--and those that care for the sojourner--to invest in our collective future. The tendency for international students to become leaders in their societies is well-documented. The need to engage these students is clear, the opportunity for impact great, and the time opportune for a focused initiative to serve them better than ever.

## Vision
As international students enter into America’s educational system and society, we help them build relationships with counselors, mentors, their peers and their local communities to flourish, academically, emotionally, and physically. We also help parents stay engaged and informed every step of the way so families can stay close as they go through this life-changing experience.

## Values
TRUTH. Veritas means “truth.” We honor truth in all we do, and encourage students, families, and educators live with integrity and transparency in every area of life: personal, social, academic, and professional.

LEADERSHIP.  Veritas’ vision of servant leadership--of oneself or one’s family, or in an academic, social, or professional setting--involves: 1) a commitment to understanding truth; 2) developing, communicating, and executing a vision; and 3) sacrificing to help groups realize their vision.

FLOURISHING. At Veritas, we believe that flourishing over a lifetime depends on both character (integrity, humility, wisdom, compassion, and empathy) and achievement (fluency in English, communication, prioritization, follow-through).

## What We Do
* DIRECT SERVICES TO FAMILIES: We will help families design customized “Family Flourishing Plans” and connect them to highly-qualified professionals who offer outstanding academic, cultural, and emotional support. Students will also have opportunities to participate in unique orientation programs, retreats, and leadership training with multi-generational, cross-cultural mentors. These opportunities will be off cycle from academic commitments, including during vacations and long weekends. Veritas will also help parents better understand the cultural dynamics that their children face—a particularly important issue for teenagers studying in U.S. schools. The focal point of Veritas’ direct service offerings will be the Mid-Atlantic region, for students in the Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Baltimore areas.
* SURVEY RESEARCH: We are disciplined and research-based in our approach. We survey students, their families, teachers, and administrators, to develop in-depth understanding of their experiences rather than guessing why certain things are happening. Veritas’ first surveys will explore the perspectives and experiences of international students in public and private high schools in the U.S. as well as in their first months of university-level education, as well as the perspectives and experiences of parents whose children are studying or will study in the U.S.
* SUPPORT FOR EDUCATORS: The education sector attracts people who are committed to the well-being of students. We will offer thought leadership to this community to support more holistic flourishing of international student families and their cultural inclusion within American society. Veritas’ initiatives will include publishing on topics of interest to the community (subscribe on our website!) as well as professional development workshops and training programs. Veritas will also explore ways to serve educators who are addressing the special needs of international students with severe culture shock/mental health issues or learning and physical disabilities, an especially challenging topic for educators when culture intersects with parent communication needs.

## About Us
Veritas International Education is a program of the Kids World Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to building cross-cultural understanding through relationships. Veritas offers fee-based services; any surpluses will be reinvested in thought leadership and professional development for international educators.
