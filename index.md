## Background
America's education system is one of the most successful ways that we interact with the world. Over one million international students now study in the United States, bringing more than $30 billion per year to the U.S. economy. Students are coming to the U.S. at younger ages and the number of international students enrolling in American high schools is surging. It is more important than ever that the U.S. care well for students from other countries. Americans can invest in our collective future by engaging with international students who are poised to become cross-cultual leaders. Veritas will provide opportunities for both Americans and international students to develop cultural intelligence through relationships.

## Vision
Veritas surrounds international students and their families with communities to help care for their academic, emotional, and physical needs. We connect students with academic counselors, personal mentors,  peers of different cultures and  local communities so that they  flourish during their time in America. We also help parents stay engaged and informed to help families grow closer as they go through this life-changing experience.

## Values
TRUTH. Veritas means “truth" and we seek honor truth in all we do. We equip and encourage students to live with integrity and transparency in every area of life: personal, social, academic, and professional.

LEADERSHIP.  Veritas’ vision of leadership is that of a servant who humbly seeks to understand the needs of others in personal,  academic, social, and professional settings This includes: 1) a commitment to understanding truth; 2) developing, communicating, and executing a vision; and 3) helping groups realize their vision, including through sacrifice.

FLOURISHING. At Veritas, we believe that flourishing over a lifetime depends on building character (integrity, wisdom, and empathy) as well as cultivating achievement ( communication skills, prioritization, follow-through).

## What We Do
* DIRECT SERVICES TO FAMILIES: We design customized “Family Flourishing Plans” and connect students and families to highly-qualified professionals for outstanding academic, cultural, and emotional support. Students can take part in unique orientation programs, retreats, and leadership training with multi-generational, cross-cultural mentors during vacations and long weekends. Veritas will help parents understand cultural dynamics that their children face as teenagers studying in U.S. schools. 
* SURVEY RESEARCH: To be disciplined and research-based in our approach, we survey students, families, and educators to build in-depth understanding of their experiences rather than guessing why certain things are happening. Veritas’ first surveys will explore the perspectives and experiences of international students in in the U.S. and experiences of their parents.
* SUPPORT FOR EDUCATORS:  We will offer thought leadership to the education sector to support holistic flourishing of international student families and their cultural inclusion within American society. We will publish on topics of interest to this community and hold professional development workshops and training programs. Veritas will also serve work with educators to serve families whose children have addressing special needs, including culture shock/mental health. It is particularly important to help parents and service-providers effectively communicate across cultures in this area of need.
